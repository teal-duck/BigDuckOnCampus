- Added Collidable.floorDiv() so it's compatible with < Java 8

- Run Eclipse source cleanup on project

- Commented out unused variables

- Renaming variables to consistent style (lowerCamelCase)

- Changing some variables to use enums
	- RoomType
	- AttackType
	- EnemyShotType
	- MovementType
	- ObjectiveType
	- LevelType
		- Changed MuscovyGame.mapSelected to use this
		- Levels are 0-7 but mapSelected was 1-8
		- Updated the logic for this
	- GameState
	- PlayerShotType
	- ProjectileDamager (need to think of better name for this)
	
- Trying to cleanup magic numbers
	- Coordinates for rendering between relative to the window size
	
- Changed "float x, y, xVelocity, yVelocity, angle;" etc to use Vector2 position, velocity

- Created shootProjectiles() static function in projectile class to remove duplicate of logic
	- Player and enemy now use this as it handles bullet spread for multiple shots
	
- Created TextureMap, changed all texture loading to use it instead so they can be disposed
	- Originally, for every entity and bullet, the texture was reloaded from file every time it was used
		- Slows game down
		- Wastes memory
	- Now the getTextureOrLoadFile method only loads the texture the first time it is requested
		- Else just returns the already loaded instance
	- TextureMap.disposeAllTextures() called in MuscovyGame.dispose() (i.e. when the game window closes)

- Player clampVelocity now uses velocity.limit() instead of changing components
	- Mathematically correct, but changes gameplay

- Boss now spawns in a random room
	- Used to pick the first room it found with only 1 neighbour, starting in bottom left
	- Now builds a list of all potential rooms (only 1 neighbour), then picks a random one
	
- Boss parameters (move speed, shot speed) being changed

- Now renders a map overlay
	- Graphics need to be changed
	- Helpful for debugging
	
	

When enemies are in bottom corners, player can't shoot them from the side
Collision could maybe use our code from featherline york?
Need to change where the boss room spawns - currently always favours bottom left
Player and enemy projectiles should look different
